<p class="z4"><strong>4.</strong> On March, 23th the evening took place in Pushkin club, devoted to the World day of poetry - read about it an editorial article on Russian in the newspaper « Evening Nikolaev » from March, 27th <a href="../rus/dp2008.html" target="_blank" class="link2">« All transient - the poetry is eternal »</a>.</p>

<p class="z4"><strong>5.</strong> In the newspaper « Evening Nikolaev » on March, 25th article <a href="../rus/war.html" target="_blank" class="link2">« Us nursed war … »</a> by A.Zolotukhin is published, here we bring article on Russian without denominations.</p>




<p class="z4"><strong>6. </strong> These Christmas days we glorify the God, as our Belief, Hope and Love. 
And at once Pushkin is recollected:</p><DIV align=center>
      <P class=k0 align=center>THE CHRIST WAS BORN!<br>
WE GLORIFY HIM!</P></DIV>
<div class="z7"><p>* * *<br>

If the life will deceive you,<br>Do not mourn, do not become angry!<br>
In day of despondency reconcile:<br>Day of fun, trust, will be come.</p>
<p>Heart in the future lives;<br>The present is sad:<br>
All instantly, all will pass:<br>That will pass, it will be lovely.</p></div>
<p class="z4"><strong>7. </strong> The last year was year of a pig on east calendar and to get rid of beastliness in New 2008, in section of "Publication" (on Russian) in division « Publicistic articles » we place the letter of Pushkin club City to head V.D. Chayka. To the seagull which, alas, about this day is left by mayor even without the formal answer. It is a unprecedented case of obviously disrespectful relation of city authority to the public organization working since 1989, through which for this time has passed some thousand inhabitants of our city. The members of club so much and have disinterestedly made for preservation of historical memory and culture in Sacred Nikolay's city. This direct certificate of absence  culture authorities concerning to historical memory - for 2 years at city authority was not 300$ for restoration of a memorial board on A.P.Zontag's house, in which А.S. Pushkin has written the best lines, devoted to womens and the beginning of the letter of Tatyana to Onegin from "Evgenie Onegin" (read article on Russian « In Nikolaev it is necessary to stop at Zontags… »). Let alone that 5-th year lays, the made memorial board to an outstanding public figure of our city of G.N. Ge (read article on Russian « the Deputy of a municipal duma »), but for this time city authorities and could not install it on his house on street Navarinskaja, 25.</p>

<p class="z4"><strong>8. </strong> Unfortunately, the freedom of speech at us exists only on 2 television programs, and in press it is subordinated or money, or to still telephone right. In the past to year I could not publish in the central and local press ("Day", « the Southern truth », « Evening Nikolaev », « the Nikolaev business ») article about the outstanding founder of our culture Ilarion-Nikon (997-1088) deduced in « Slovo o polku Igoreve » under a name of the Bayan. It has not been published in local newspapers and my article  "the Letter to the scientist to the neighbour" (on Russian), therefore we place them in subitem « Publicistic articles » section of "Publication".</p>

<p class="z4"><strong>9. </strong> According to the <a href="prog2008_e.html" target="_blank" class="link2">program of work of Pushkin club</a> on Sunday on January, 27th, at 14 o'clock, in a musical drawing room of an art museum by name V.V.Vereschagin took place evening of club "Love of page music stores ", as the executor on a grand piano and the author musically-literatures of compositions Natalia Papushenko has acted, Alla Velichko has taken part in evening - a soprano. Have been executed: « the Lunar sonata » and «To Eliza» by Beethoven, «Serenade» by Schubert, «the Song without words » by Mendelson, "Romance" and Schuman's "Waltz", Brams's "Waltz", two "Waltzes" of Shopen, « As spirit of Laura » and « Dreams of love » by List, and also a romance « I Love you » and « Wedding day in Trollhausen » by Grieg.</p>
