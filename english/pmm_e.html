<p class="k0"><strong>Pushkin - my dream</strong></p>
<p class="zz4">You can ask, why on the title page of the composition I have written - « Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin has changed my life »? This history is very simple.</p>
<p class="zz4">The first book which to me have presented, were A.S.Pushkina's "Fairy tales". Thus one of the brightest impressions of the early childhood. Mum has told, that it her favourite fairy tales. So I have got acquainted with Pushkin's creativity and when I have learned to read - this book again became the first, the first, which I completely read itself! Already going to school, I have opened for myself Alexander Sergeevicha's verses on the nature. And each new poem amazed my imagination with beauty of sounding, unusual images, simplicity and complexity simultaneously. Pushkin has helped me to understand greatness and magnificence of the nature, to see beauty that at first sight is not attractive. « Sad it is time, eyes charm … » Unless it is possible to describe more precisely beauty of the nature and grief which is cast by the magician-autumn.</p>
 <p class="zz4">Once in the summer evening when I with parents had a rest in Crimea, mum has read through by heart unusually beautiful poem. It was « Tatyana's Letter » from the novel in Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin's verses "Evgenie Onegin". I very much wanted prohonour all product, but parents have told, that in ten years rather early it to read. We have come back home, and mum, having conceded to requests, has put before me the book with words: « I do not know, whether you will understand the contents up to the end, but pleasure from reading will receive, precisely! » As she was right! Reading "Evgeniy Onegin", I could not come off. It seemed to me, that in my head music sounds, and each phrase reveals a magnificent flower. This product has so shaken, that I have started to write verses. That is why I consider, that Pushkin has changed my life!</p>
<p class="zz4">Now I study in 6 class and I continue to write verses. When to me it is sad, I read my favourite poet, and the life has new paints, there is an inspiration. My dream - to write such poem which will be so easy and beautiful as Pushkin. And let my surname will help me with this! (Surname Talanova from '"talent")</p>
