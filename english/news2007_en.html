<div class="zz4"><strong>Publisher’s opinion</strong> 

<p>“In 2005, Nikolaev archeologists Yu.S. Grebennikov, K.V. Gorbenko and A.I. Smirnov completed the cycle of excavations in the tract “Wild orchard” (see p. 26). Due to this fact it became clear that a great scientific discovery has been made. In his brief “Conclusion on the archeological monument “Wild orchard”, located in Nikolaev, doctor of history, prof., deputy director of Research Institute of Monuments Protection, Corresponding member of the German Institute of Archeology, V.I. Klochko wrote the following:
“Archeological monument “Wild orchard” is a site of ancient settlement of late bronze (Byelozerski period, 1300-900 B.C.). It is situated on the high bank of the Southern Bug, at the place where the Ingul river flows into it. The place of the monument location and some finds on it allow us to interpret it as an old town-port, situated on the trade route that connected the basins of the Black and Baltic along the rivers of the Western Bug and the Southern Bug.</p>
<p>Thus, the “Wild orchard” ancient settlement is the only archeological monument in Ukraine – the remnants of the Black Sea town-port of the times of legendary Troy and the Troyan war itself.
The way the remnants of habitations, temples and fortification installation were preserved allows us with a high degree of confidence  to register and rehabilitate these erections as well as the whole site of the town. All the indicated circumstances put forward the “Wild orchard” ancient settlement as the most outstanding monuments of all-European archeological heritage and now we have to consider the necessity of its preservation and registering this great discovery as a museum. It will allow to put it into the row of outstanding monuments of the world cultural heritage”. </p>
<p>The researchers write that within 15 years of studies carried on by the local archeological expedition, about 19 archeological objects were investigated (including temples, part of fortification wall and stone bridge across it), 15 premises of various functional designation, thousands of artifacts were found. The depth of cultural layer is from 0.15 to 0.5 m, and overall area constitutes about 3 hectares. On the basis of the facts the researchers indicate that “it is quite logical to state that “Wild orchard” tract is that same centre,- ‘the town of Cimmerian people”,- that was mentioned by Homer in his “Odyssey”. The monument has been only 40% investigated.”</p>
