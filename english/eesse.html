". And restore model warship to solve secret of trip Pushkin " on a locust". The assumption is stated and the proofs to  are given that in the beginning of October, 1823 Pushkin secretly came to Nikolaev from Odessa on a yacht "Utekha", that has become the original reason of dispatch him from Odessa in Mikhaylovskoe. It was possible to find three houses, in which V.I.Dahl lived in Nikolaev to prove, that Dahl did not write calumnious poems on the spouse of the admiral Greyg. In Nikolaev Pushkin, on my researches, has written a beginning of the letter Tatiana to Onegin and some stanzas from 1-st and 3-rd chapters of "Evgeniy Onegin". On the basis of researches the historical information's are prepared and are established in Nikolaev a memorial board (1987) and monument to the Poet (1988).
